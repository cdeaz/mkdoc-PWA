## What is VueJS ?
---
Vue is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

Vue.js has made the update process easy. While releasing any major update, Vue.js makes sure that it is as much backward compatible as possible. 

* Progressive
Vue.js is progressive. It means that the framework can be introduced in your code gradually, and you can work on your app component by the component, which makes the entire process more manageable. 

* Size-efficient
Vue.js applications are very small in size and thus offers better performance than the equivalent frameworks. Vue.js framework provides a lot of optimizations, which means that developers can focus on adding new features to the application and less worry about tweaking the application. 

* Handy conventions

* Extremely popular
Vue.js is gaining a lot of popularity with time. It is being used by many giant players, including Facebook, Netflix, Adobe, Xiaomi, Alibaba, Grammarly, Gitlab, Behance, and many others. 

Due to easy learning curve, it is easy to move your existing team to Vue.js rather than hiring new developers.
