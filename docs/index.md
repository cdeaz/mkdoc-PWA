What are Progressive Web Applications or PWAs for short? How can it make our life as an Angular developer better? 

To understand what PWAs are all about, and how you can build them in Angular let's consider the following scenario.
You are out and about in an area with little or no network reception. Your are using a cool a web app to search for a good book to read.
Traditional web applications only work while you are online. Every time you lose the network the application will stall.
What's more, a typical app will load all of its scripts before starting up. This means that you might have to wait a minute or more for the first page to load. In conditions like this, you will quickly give up and the application altogether.

This is where progressive web applications come into play. PWAs leverage a number of current browser technologies in order to provide a smooth user experience even in situations with little or no network connection. 
They use service workers which act a little like a proxy to intercept network requests and cache the responses. 
They allow the complete application to be installed in the client's browser.

In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a complete progressive web app in Angular. 
The application will allow the user to search medical products using a DataSource.
