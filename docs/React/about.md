## What is React ?
---
React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing. Redux and React Router are respective examples of such libraries.

* Declarative
React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

* Component-Based
Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

* Learn Once, Write Anywhere
We don’t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.

React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

## Why choose React ?
---
The many Reasons why react js can be best choice for your project :  

- It’s easy to learn
React, compared to other popular frontend frameworks like Angular & Vue, is much easier to learn. In fact, it’s one of the main reasons why React gained so much traction in little time. It helps businesses quickly build their projects.

You see, the harder it is to learn a particular technology or framework, the more time it will take to begin the development process. And we, as human beings, often tend to avoid things that are difficult to learn.
But, since React is a simple framework that is easy to learn and get started, businesses and big brands are more inclined towards using it.

- It helps to build rich user interfaces
Today, the quality of the user interface in an application plays an important role. If the user interface is poorly designed, then it lowers the chances of an application to succeed.

But, if an application has high-quality UI, then there are better chances that your users will love to use the app.
Therefore, building rich user interfaces is sort of necessary for an application to survive and thrive.

The good news is, React allows building such high-quality, rich user interfaces through its declarative components, which brings us to our next point.

- It allows writing custom components
React comes with JSX, an optional syntax extension, which makes it possible to write your own components.
These components basically accept HTML quoting and also makes all subcomponent rendering a delightful experience for developers.

Though there have been many debates on the matter of JSX, but it has already for writing custom components, building high-volume applications, and converting HTML mockups into ReactElement trees.

- It uplifts developers’ productivity
Frequent updates often turn into headaches when an app has a complex logic and when a single modification in one component can dramatically affect other components.
But, to combat this problem, Facebook has amplified React with the component reusability feature.
Component reusability in React basically allows developers to redeploy the same digital objects.

The process is simple too! – developers, for example, can begin adding simple components such as button, text fields, and checkbox and then move them to wrapper components, which are ultimately moved forward to the root component.
This approach basically provides better code maintenance and growth as each component in React has their own internal logic, which is easy to manipulate and as a result, boosts the productivity of application development.

- It offers fast rendering
When you’re building a complex, high-load app, it becomes mandatory to define the structure of the app in the beginning since it can impact the performance of your app.

In simple words, the DOM model is tree-structured. So, a minor modification at a higher level layer can awfully impact the user interface of an application. To solve this, Facebook has introduced a virtual DOM feature.
Virtual DOM, as the name suggests, is the virtual representation of DOM that allows testing all changes to the virtual DOM first to calculate risks with each modification.

This approach, as a result, helps to maintain high app performance and guarantees a better user experience.

- It is SEO-friendly
For any online business, search engine optimization is the gateway to success.
According to Moz, the lower the page load time and the faster the rendering speed, the higher an app will rank on Google.
Thanks to the fast rendering, React, compared to other frameworks, significantly reduces the page load time, which greatly helps businesses in securing the first rank on Google Search Engine Result Page.

- It comes with useful developer toolset
Learning emerging technologies and using them in real-life projects can be both fun and beneficial, but only if they are used correctly.
Facebook understands this and it’s for this reason they have added much needed React dev tools and Chrome dev tools in their React JS framework.

These React tools basically help developers discover child and parent components, observe component hierarchies, and inspect components’ present state and props.

- Strong community support
Like Angular, React also has very strong community support, which is one of the main reasons to adopt React JS in your project.

Every day, a large number of individual React developers are contributing towards making React a better frontend framework. Currently, React JS has attained 136,079 stars on Github and 1,331 regular contributors.

Not only that, but experts are also regularly uploading free React tutorials on Youtube and writing in-depth React tutorial articles & blogs on the internet. For instance, a simple “free React tutorial” search on Google gives 13,00,00,000 results.

Apart from this, React experts are also regularly solving doubts on QA sites like Stack Overflow and Quora, meaning if you ever get stuck while using React, you can always get reliable solutions given by experts.

- It offer better code stability
React follows downward data flow to ensure that the parent structure don’t get affected by any modifications in its child structure.

So, whenever a developer makes changes in an object, he or she only needs to modify its states and make proper amendments. This way only a specific component will be updated.

This data flow and structure, as a result, provide better code stability and smooth performance of the application.

- It is used by many fortune 500 companies

Check out some inspiring examples of React solutions. Thousands of companies, including some Fortune 500 companies, have chosen React JS for their websites and mobile apps.

Airbnb, Tesla, Tencent QQ, and Walmart are among the top brands that built their mobile apps using the React Native framework.React web framework, on the other hand, is currently being utilized by famous companies including Netflix, Paypal, NASA, BBC, Lyft, and New York Times to name just a few.

The point is, since so many successful and Fortune 500 companies are using React & React Native, then React must be truly useful frontend and mobile app development framework.


## So what are the advantages of Angular?
---

The React JS offers tons of benefits. Let’s see the key benefits of React JS to understand why it stands out from other front-end development frameworks.

- Speed :  

The React basically allows developers to utilize individual parts of their application on both client-side and the server-side, which ultimately boosts the speed of the development process.

In simple terms, different developers can write individual parts and all changes made won’t cause the logic of the application.

- Flexibility :  

Compared to other frontend frameworks, the React code is easier to maintain and is flexible due to its modular structure. This flexibility, in turn, saves huge amount of time and cost to businesses.

- Performance :  

React JS was designed to provide high performance in mind. The core of the framework offers a virtual DOM program and server-side rendering, which makes complex apps run extremely fast.

- Usability :    

Deploying React is fairly easy to accomplish if you have some basic knowledge of JavaScript.

In fact, an expert JavaScript developer can easily learn all ins and outs of the React framework in a matter of a day or two.

- Mobile app development :  

If you thought React is for web development only, you could not be more wrong! Facebook has already upgraded the framework for developing mobile native applications for both Android & iOS platforms.
