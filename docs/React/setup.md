# Start with Angular

--- 

## What is the CLI ?

The CLI or "Command Line Interface" (a tool for excuting commands from the console), from Angular is the tool that allows you to execute scripts for the creation, structuring and production a Angular applicayion.

## Install the tools

You must install the following tools if you do not already have them on your machine:

### Node.js
---
Download and install the latest LTS version of Node.js here:

 [NodeJS Download Website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### NPM
---
NPM is a package manager that allows the installation of a lot of tools and libraries that you will need for any type of development. To install it, open a command line and type the following command:

```npm
npm install -g npm @latest
```

> **Note :** If the command fails for a permission problem on Mac or Linux, you can launch it in superuser mode with  sudo or consult the following documentation.

## Angular / CLI
---
You will now install the Angular CLI globally on your machine with the following command (with sudo if necessary) :

```npm
npm install -g @ angular / cli
```
From there, the command `ng` is available from the command line from any folder on the computer.

> **Note :** For more information, you can find the documentation for each element on the corresponding site:

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) 
* [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/) 
* [ng](https://cli.angular.io/)



### Material theme
---

```pip
pip install mkdocs-material 
```

Then change in `mkdocs.yml` and add:  

``` material
theme: "material"
```
##### Your development environment is now ready.

> **Note :** I advise you too use an editor like VS Code or Atom. Also, use Chrome as your default browser for development, because the Developer Tools are very complete, and you also have the possibility of installing Augury, a specific Chrome plugin for Angular development.
